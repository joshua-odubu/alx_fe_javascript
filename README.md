üß† Dynamic Quote Generator

Directory: alx_fe_javascript/dom-manipulation
Repository: alx_fe_javascript


üìã Project Overview

The Dynamic Quote Generator demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, Web Storage, JSON handling, and client‚Äìserver synchronization using vanilla JavaScript.
Each task progressively enhances the app from a static quote display into an interactive, network-aware web application that mimics real-world data syncing and conflict resolution.


üöÄ Features by Task

Task 0 ‚Äì Building a Dynamic Content Generator
	‚Ä¢	Created dynamic HTML content entirely through JavaScript DOM APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Displayed random quotes from an in-memory array.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented showRandomQuote() using Math.random() for randomized output.

Task 1 ‚Äì Implementing Web Storage and JSON Handling
	‚Ä¢	Integrated Local Storage to persist quotes across sessions.
	‚Ä¢	Used Session Storage to remember the last displayed quote.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented JSON import/export with:
	‚Ä¢	FileReader + readAsText() for file uploads.
	‚Ä¢	Blob + URL.createObjectURL() for JSON downloads.

Task 2 ‚Äì Creating a Dynamic Content Filtering System
	‚Ä¢	Added a category filter (<select>) dynamically populated from stored quotes.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented populateCategories() and filterQuotes() for real-time filtering.
	‚Ä¢	Persisted the user‚Äôs last selected filter using Local Storage.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically updated categories when new quotes were added or imported.

Task 3 ‚Äì Syncing Data with Server and Conflict Resolution
	‚Ä¢	Introduced server simulation using the mock API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented two-way data syncing via syncQuotes():
	‚Ä¢	Fetches new quotes from the server (GET).
	‚Ä¢	Pushes local quotes to the server using fetch() with:

method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }


	‚Ä¢	Conflict resolution strategy: server data takes precedence (‚Äúserver wins‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Real-time notifications with visual toasts (notifyUser()).
	‚Ä¢	Periodic auto-sync every 60 seconds.
	‚Ä¢	Console message "Quotes synced with server!" confirms successful syncs.


üß© Core Technologies

Technology	Purpose
HTML 5	Page structure and placeholders
CSS 3	Minimal UI styling
JavaScript (ES6)	Logic, DOM manipulation, data persistence
Web Storage API	Local & Session storage
JSON API	Import/export and mock server data
Fetch API	HTTP GET & POST requests to mock server


‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/joshua-odubu/alx_fe_javascript.git
cd alx_fe_javascript/dom-manipulation


	2.	Open index.html in your browser
        The app runs entirely client-side ‚Äî no server setup required.
	3.	Interact with the app
	‚Ä¢	Click ‚ÄúShow New Quote‚Äù to get a random quote.
	‚Ä¢	Use the category filter to view specific categories.
	‚Ä¢	Add your own quotes and export/import JSON files.
	‚Ä¢	Observe background sync logs and toasts when connecting to the mock API.


üß™ Testing Checklist

‚úÖ Random quote display uses Math.random()
‚úÖ Quotes persist after refresh (Local Storage)
‚úÖ JSON import/export works with FileReader and readAsText()
‚úÖ Category filter updates dynamically
‚úÖ syncQuotes() fetches and merges server data
‚úÖ method, POST, headers, and Content-Type appear in POST requests
‚úÖ Console shows ‚ÄúQuotes synced with server!‚Äù after each sync


üèÅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project you learned how to:
	‚Ä¢	Manipulate the DOM dynamically without frameworks.
	‚Ä¢	Persist data with Local and Session Storage.
	‚Ä¢	Work with JSON data and files.
	‚Ä¢	Simulate real-world client/server syncing.
	‚Ä¢	Implement basic conflict resolution and user feedback systems.
